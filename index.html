    <div class="letter">
        <p>Hi there!</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by. We're currently working on some exciting things behind the scenes, and our website is still a work in progress. But while we're busy putting everything together, we'd love to share our vision!</p>

        <p>In a hurry? <strong><a href="#tldr" class="manifesto-link">Scroll down for a TL;DR.</a></strong></p>

        <div class="manifesto-section">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="manifesto-text">
                <strong>Humanityâ€™s progress has stemmed from one thing: Curiosity.</strong> <br><br>
                From deploying the internet to sending rovers to Marsâ€”every innovation (even the accidental microwave!) has only ever existed because its creator was naturally curious about something. Curiosity pushes us to naturally ask questions, explore, and challenge the boundaries of what we know.<br><br>
                Yet, this same curiosity often withers within the confines of modern education. <br><br>
                The challenge lies in how learning has been reduced to a transactional activity. Students are taught to study for tests, not to explore the deeper meaning behind what theyâ€™re learning. As a result, our education system often values rote memorization over genuine understanding, compliance over curiosity, and short-term achievements over long-term intellectual growth.<br><br>
                Our mission is to change that by introducing a new model of educationâ€”one suited for the 21st century. A model that teaches problem-solving and intuition, not just formulas, and is uniquely suited to scale with the emerging capabilities driven by the AI revolution.<br><br>
                The end goal? <strong>An interactive, dynamic course experienceâ€”designed for the 21st century.</strong><br><br>
                In this model, we envision a course that is generated on-the-fly from a single prompt, and is structured where youâ€™re learning by doing â€“ no videos, textbooks, or lectures; everything is interactive. The content is structured as an experience of guided discovery, designed to improve your ability to think and reason from first principles, and really learn a subject. Since the content is generated in real-time for you, you gain the ability to explore any topic at your own pace without having to adhere to a pre-defined curriculum, all with the content fundamentally engineered to foster your curiosity for the subject.<br><br>
                So thatâ€™s our end goal, but we still have a lot of work to do! As such, weâ€™re excited to embark on this journey of, wellâ€¦ curiosity!<br><br>
                We hope youâ€™re as excited as we are!

            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> We believe education should foster curiosity, not stifle it. Our goal is to build an interactive, AI-driven learning experience that teaches through discovery, not rote memorization.
