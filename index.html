        <p>Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. We're currently working on some exciting things behind the scenes, and our website is still a work in progress. But while we're busy putting everything together, we wanted to share <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1agvnLe0dD8wDqHdlyIPjqCoD_PP5oLBda7ixQpgTk6g/edit?" class="manifesto-link">our manifesto</a> with you—our vision and what we're all about.</p>
        <p>We believe in teaching through intuition, creating dynamic, hands-on learning experiences that make complex ideas easy to grasp and fun to explore. It's not just about memorizing facts—it's about understanding, discovering, and growing.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned, we can't wait to share more with you soon!</p>
