        <h1>Welcome to Curiosity Education!</h1>
        <p>Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. We're currently working on some exciting things behind the scenes, and our website is still a work in progress. But while we're busy putting everything together, we wanted to share our manifesto with you—our vision and what we're all about.</p>
        <p>We believe in teaching through intuition, creating dynamic, hands-on learning experiences that make complex ideas easy to grasp and fun to explore. It's not just about memorizing facts—it's about understanding, discovering, and growing.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned, we can't wait to share more with you soon!</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hi. We're excited to have you along on this journey with us!</p>
